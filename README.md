# Maze Mastermind
This autonomous maze solver guides a ball through the maze by tilting the platform in the direction generated by the A* algorithm. This popular path-planning algorithm finds the shortest path, given a start point and a goal point.

## How It Works?

The assembly consists of a Raspberry Pi, a camera, and servos. The camera is mounted directly on top of the maze. It captures an image of the maze, divides the image into grid cells, and identifies the black cells as 'un-walkable'. It also detects where a small red-colored ball is. It then finds the shortest path from that ball to a defined 'goal node'.

The generated path is translated into directions like 'Up', 'Down', 'Right', 'Left', etc. Then the Raspberry Pi signals the servos to rotate the platform in the sequence of generated directions to guide the ball through the maze. The camera frequently captures a new image for accurate feedback of where the red ball is.

## Here's a demonstration of the generated path in different scenarios:
